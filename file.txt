RFC 3602        AES-CBC Cipher Algorithm Use with IPsec   September 2003

2.2.  Key Size and Number of Rounds

   AES supports three key sizes: 128 bits, 192 bits, and 256 bits.  The
   default key size is 128 bits, and all implementations MUST support
   this key size.  Implementations MAY also support key sizes of 192
   bits and 256 bits.

   AES uses a different number of rounds for each of the defined key
   sizes.  When a 128-bit key is used, implementations MUST use 10
   rounds.  When a 192-bit key is used, implementations MUST use 12
   rounds.  When a 256-bit key is used, implementations MUST use 14
   rounds.

2.3.  Weak Keys

   At the time of writing this document there are no known weak keys for
   the AES.

   Some cipher algorithms have weak keys or keys that MUST not be used
   due to their interaction with some aspect of the cipher's definition.
   If weak keys are discovered for the AES, then weak keys SHOULD be
   checked for and discarded when using manual key management.  When
   using dynamic key management, such as [IKE], weak key checks SHOULD
   NOT be performed as they are seen as an unnecessary added code
   complexity that could weaken the intended security [EVALUATION].

2.4.  Block Size and Padding

   The AES uses a block size of sixteen octets (128 bits).

   Padding is required by the AES to maintain a 16-octet (128-bit)
   blocksize.  Padding MUST be added, as specified in [ESP], such that
   the data to be encrypted (which includes the ESP Pad Length and Next
   Header fields) has a length that is a multiple of 16 octets.

   Because of the algorithm specific padding requirement, no additional
   padding is required to ensure that the ciphertext terminates on a 4-
   octet boundary (i.e., maintaining a 16-octet blocksize guarantees
   that the ESP Pad Length and Next Header fields will be right aligned
   within a 4-octet word).  Additional padding MAY be included, as
   specified in [ESP], as long as the 16-octet blocksize is maintained.
